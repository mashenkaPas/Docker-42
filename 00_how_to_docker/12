#-e, --env list â€” Set environment variables.
#MySQL includes a mysql_native_password plugin that implements native authentication; that is, authentication based on the password hashing method in use from before the introduction of pluggable authentication
#MySQL client programs use mysql_native_password by default. The --default-auth option can be used as a hint about which client-side plugin the program can expect to use:

#docker run -d --name spawning-pool --restart=on-failure:10 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Kerrigan -e MYSQL_DATABASE=zerglings --volume hatchery:/var/lib/mysql mysql --default-auth=mysql_native_password
#The best variant to use code below ,beause in ex14 you need launch a wordpress container and it should be able to use the spawning-pool container as a database
service, but mysql:8 changed loginsystem, so it would give the errors, that's why its better to use mysql:5.7 version  

docker run --name spawning-pool -v hatchery --restart always -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Kerrigan -e MYSQL_DATABASE=zerglings -d mysql:5.7
